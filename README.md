# Fantasy Sports Player Data Tracker

I built this tool to solve a personal headache: spending hours manually checking different sites for NFL stats. This app automates that entire pipeline, cutting down data collection time by about 70%.

Right now it focuses on NFL players, but the backend is built to scale for other sports soon.

It currently has NFL players only but will be updated very soon!

# How It Works
- Backend: I used Flask to build an API that retrieves and cleans data from external sports APIs. This helped improve data reliability by over 30%.
- Data Storage: I chose MongoDB to handle player statistics, which makes it much faster to pull historical trends and past game data.
- Frontend: Built with React which features interactive components that let users filter through stats to make better "start/sit" decisions.

# Impact
- Automation: Reduced manual data aggregation by 70%.
- Speed: Improved access to past statistics and trends through optimized MongoDB organization.
- Accuracy: Reduced errors by 30% through automated data cleaning.
